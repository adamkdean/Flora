  Digital plant simulation project
</p>

----

### What is this project?

A digital plant simulator. Something I've wanted to write for a while but very rarely had the time or motivation. Now with the 2020 Global Lockdown and some time off, I can finally work on it.

### What is the goal?

At first, to simulate basic plant lifecycle, with adjustable environmental factors such as sunlight, day length, precipitation, etc. In time, genetic factors could be added too, so that offspring can adjust to environmental factors.

### What is the current status?

I haven't even started it yet.
